#variable declaration
X=2, Y=-3, Z=0.4
#above declares the variables under respective variable type#
#example X=2 is an integar, Z=0.4 is an float type#
#print function is used to print the value#
print(type(x))
#the above prints the value of X as 2. Output will be 2
#below command shows how to assign values into a variable and also determines the variable type of y
P=type(y)
#here the output will be an integar
print(p)
#== operator checks whether the values are same. comparative operator
X==Y
print(X==Y)
#the output will be true or false
#below command gets the input from user and store in the variable a and b respectively
a=input("Enter the 1st number")
b=input("Enter the 2nd number")
#below command make the sum of above two values received
c=a+b
#below command prints the value of sum
print(c)
